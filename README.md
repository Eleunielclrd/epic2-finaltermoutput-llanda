Creating mandala using the p5.js Web editor

I don't really know about ps5.js and I'm not good in coding so i just made basic shapes. This pattern came up from what i have watched from my references and for my work i didn't expect much but i like it its kind of simple but
It's good start for me.

If there will be face to face soon i would like to learn more about coding and game development.
